        <p>This page could have some basic info about me and my history with drawing</p>
        <p>Also put the slide boxes for the different tabs here too with explanations on what they contain</p>

        Art has always been a major part of my life, and I try to sketch as often as I can. My preferred style is ink sketching, although 
        sometimes I branch out into different mediums like watercolor and digital art. I tend to stick with more character focused doodles and sketches, usually moreso fantasy styled, 
        although I've been wanting to delve farther into architecture sketching, as well as comics and graphic novel approaches.
        Along with drawing and sketching, I also dabble in 3D modeling and animation, as well as some video editing. 
        To top off the artistic jack of all trades, I'm hoping to get reaquainted with music in the future.
